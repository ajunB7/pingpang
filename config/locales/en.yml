# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      title: How does the tournament work?
      body_html: '<p>In each round of the tournament, players are divided into tiers.</p>
        <p>There are 5 tiers (Admin, Ambassador, Awesome, etc), with at least 4 players in each tier.</p>
        <p>Within a tier, every player plays every other player, and records their scores.</p>
        <p>Once all tiers have finished playing, the round is over, and the top two players from each tier move up to the tier above them, while the bottom players move down.</p>
        <p>Over time, players in each tier should be more or less evenly matched, making for funner pairings.</p>
        <p>The goal is <b>fun</b>, and to produce a system where your matches are fair and enjoyable!</p>'

      title: How are points calculated?
      body_html: ' <p> Your score for each game is calculated as follows:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>You get 11 points for playing</li>
            <li>Add the number of points you scored against your opponent</li>
            <li>Subtract the number of points scored against you.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>So, if you won the game 11-8, you would earn <code>11 + 11 - 8</code> or <code>14</code> points for that game. Your opponent would earn <code>11 + 8 - 11</code> or <code>8</code> points.</p>
        <p>The lowest score you can get for a game is 0 points (lost 0-11).</p>
        <p>The highest score you can get for a game is 22 points (won 11-0).</p>
        <p>If you forfeit a game, you get -11 points.</p>
        <p>Your position in the tier is calculated by adding up the points earned from each game.</p>'
